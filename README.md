## Technology

The eLadder project consists of two parts:

- The app is built as a React Native app using [Expo](https://expo.io) and published to both app stores.
- The backend is a NodeJS server using Graphql through apollo-server.

## Goal of this project

This project was started as a side project to learn different new technologies (e.g. ReactNative, GraphQL). It's foremost purpose is to create a useful app for tracking games and establish leagues between friends in games like Fifa. Please be aware, that given this aim and the limited time available, this project might not always be the most consistent or use all best practices. Still, I hope that open sourcing this can give others inspiration on how to build an full-stack app with the used technologies.
